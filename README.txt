<Spaiku> it's, like, a retro OS virtual machine
<ShittyShellshock> ooooookay
<ShittyShellshock> I can't just _open_ a box file
<ShittyShellshock> i'm not a magician
<Spaiku> download and install VirtualBox
<Spaiku> download and install Vagrant
<Spaiku> then, open this directory in a COMMAND LINE
<Spaiku> and type in "vagrant up"
<ShittyShellshock> a command line? what is this, 1992?

<Spaiku> or "vagrant halt" i guess
<Spaiku> i guess

<FattoCatto> The GUI is so tiny, it sucks
<Seb> You need to switch it to scaled mode, it adds dragon wings and a flamethrower
<Seb> and also i guess lets you drag the screen size around
<Seb> that's Right-Control and C
<FattoCatto> oh, that's quite a bit better
<FattoCatto> it's capped at 1024x768, though, huh?
<Seb> such authenticity
<Seb> I refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of any resolution beyond XGA
<Seb> the ONE TRUE RESMOLUTION
<FattoCatto> How do I open the menu in scaled mode in VirtualBox?
<Seb> Ctrl-F4
<-- FattoCatto has quit (user disconnected)
<Seb> ... I mean, uh, Right-Control Home
